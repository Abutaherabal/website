    <h3><a class="anchor-icon" href="#what_greenkeeper_does" id="what_greenkeeper_does">&middot;</a>What Greenkeeper does, and why</h3>
    <p><strong>In short, Greenkeeper makes sure that you know when your project’s dependency updates break your code.</strong></p>
    <p>Greenkeeper sits between npm and GitHub, observing all of the modules your repository depends on. Each time one of them is updated, Greenkeeper opens a new branch with that update. The repository’s CI tests kick in, and Greenkeeper watches them to see whether they pass or not.</p>
    <p>Based on the test results and your current version definitions Greenkeeper will open up clear, actionable issues for you. If an update doesn’t break your code, nothing will happen, because everything is fine and no human intervention is required. If things do break, you’ll be informed immediately: you’ll know exactly which update to which dependecy caused the problem, and you’ll be nicely set up to fix the problem.</p>
    <p><strong>Doesn’t semver take care of this?</strong> Not reliably, no. Versioning decisions are still often made by humans, and <a href="http://sentimentalversioning.org/">humans often version irrationally</a>. Humans are also fallible, and sometimes miscategorize a commit. Somebody else’s <code>chore</code> may break your code, because you’re using theirs in a way they haven’t forseen. The only way to be sure is to run your tests on each and every update. And if Greenkeeper weren’t around, this would be extremely tedious, which is why basically nobody makes the effort to continually stay up to date.</p>

    <h3><a class="anchor-icon" href="#differences_between_plans" id="differences_between_plans">&middot;</a>Differences between plans</h3>
    <p>Using Greenkeeper on public repositories is free. If you intend to have it run on private repositories, you’ll need to add your payment details on in the <a href="https://account.greenkeeper.io">Greenkeeper Account Dashboard</a>.</p>
    <p><a href="http://greenkeeper.io/#pricing">Pricing</a> varies depending on the type of GitHub account Greenkeeper is installed on, and how many repositories it’s enabled for.</p>
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>

    <h3><a class="anchor-icon" href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites">&middot;</a>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>Greenkeeper has a number of requirements for each repository it is meant to watch:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The repo must have a <code>package.json</code></li>
      <li>The repo must have a form of Continuous Integration (CI) that sets commit statuses on branches (like <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>, for example, but other services work too)</li>
      <li>The CI must be active on the repo and be allowed to act on new branches</li>
      <li>Issues must be enabled for the repo</li>
      <li>The repo must not be a fork</li>
      <li>Greenkeeper doesn’t support Lerna/monorepos yet</li>
      <li>If you do not have a paid subscription, the repo must be public</li>
    </ul>
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>

    <h3><a class="anchor-icon" href="#installation" id="installation">&middot;</a>Installation</h3>
    <p>Setting up Greenkeeper to watch one of your repositories requries three steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong class="signal">Install Greenkeeper</strong>
        <p>Install the Greenkeeper GitHub app on the repository’s parent organization or user account (you’ll only need to do this once per account)</p>
        <p>To install, visit <a href='https://github.com/apps/greenkeeper'>Greenkeeper’s app page on GitHub</a> and click <code>Install</code>. If you’ve already installed it somewhere, click on <code>Configure</code> instead. You can then choose which organization or account to install the app in.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a id="grant_repo_access"></a>
        <strong class="signal">Grant repository access</strong>
        <p>Now set up the Greenkeeper app and tell it which of the account’s repositories to try and watch</p>
        <p>Find Greenkeeper’s settings page (this is a different URL for every account, so we can’t link to it, sorry). It’s in your organization or account settings under <code>Installed GitHub Apps</code>. Select Greenkeeper, and scroll all the way down to the section titled <code>Repository access</code>. Here, choose <code>Only select repositories</code> and add one or more repositories you want Greenkeeper to watch.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="signal">Enable Greenkeeper</strong>
        <p>Enable Greenkeeper on that individual repository by merging the Initial Pull Request</p>
        <p>To set itself up on a repository, Greenkeeper will open an Initial Pull Request. This will attempt to update all dependencies at once, so you’re up to date. In addition, it will add the Greenkeeper badge to your project’s <code>readme.md</code>.</p>
        <p><strong>Important: Greenkeeper will only start watching the repository’s dependencies after this pull request has been merged.</strong> It will also remind you after a few days in case you forget.</p>
        <p><strong>Also Important:</strong> The initial PR will not be opened if all dependencies are already up to date, and the <code>readme.md</code> already has a badge. In this case, Greenkeeper is silently enabled.</p>
        <p>You can check the status of each repository in the <a href="https://account.greenkeeper.io">Greenkeeper Account Dashboard</a>.</p>
        <p>The Initial Pull Request may take a while to appear, depending on how busy GitHub and your CI service are, and how complex your tests are.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>

    <h3><a class="anchor-icon" href="#repo_states" id="repo_states">&middot;</a>Checking repository states</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://account.greenkeeper.io">Account Dashboard</a> shows you each repository’s state, indicating where Greenkeeper is installed and/or enabled. Note that this list can only show repositories <a href="#grant_repo_access">you’ve granted Greenkeeper access to</a>.</p>

        alt="">
      <figcaption>The repository list in the Greenkeeper Account Dashboard</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>A repo is marked red if the Initial Pull Request doesn’t exist (yet). This could be because one or more of the <a href="#prerequisites">prerequisites</a> isn’t met, because your CI is still running and the Initial Pull Request simply isn’t ready yet, or occasionally, because some information got lost between your CI service, GitHub and Greenkeeper. If you’re sure all prerequisites are fulfilled and your CI completed its run on the Greenkeeper branch, but no Initial Pull Request appeared, you can <a href="#resetting_repos">try resetting the offending repo</a>.</p>
    <p>It is however entirely possible that you’re using npm in a way we’ve never seen before, or have your CI configured in an interesting way, or some other aspect of your setup works in a way that’s new to Greenkeeper. If you suspect this may be the case, we’d be very grateful if you could <a href="mailto:support@greenkeeper.io">let us know</a>, and we’ll to accomodate you.</p>

    <h3><a class="anchor-icon" href="#greenkeeper_step_by_step" id="greenkeeper_step_by_step">&middot;</a>How Greenkeeper works, step by step</h3>
    <p>This section covers how Greenkeeper works after the <a href="#installation">three installation steps</a> above have been completed</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong class="signal">Greenkeeper watches your dependencies for updates</strong>
        <p>Greenkeeper will watch npm’s changes feed for any update to any dependency in your <code>package.json</code>, except for those you’ve explicitly disabled.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="signal">A dependency updates occurs</strong>
        <p>Greenkeeper will open a branch that includes a single change: bumping that dependency’s version number in your <code>package.json</code>. Your CI tests will run on that branch, and once they complete, one of three things will happen:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
          <strong class="signal">It’s an in-range update, and your tests pass:</strong>
          <p>Greenkeeper deletes the branch and stays silent, because everything still works!</p>
          <p><strong>In-range means:</strong> If you specify a range of <code>^1.0.0</code>, and <code>1.0.1</code> is released, that update is in-range. Users of your package would receive this update when they run <code>npm install</code>. Consult <a href="https://semver.npmjs.com">npm’s semver calculator</a> to see which updates apply to your specified ranges, per package.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="signal">It’s an in-range update, and your tests fail:</strong>
          <p>Greenkeeper will notify you about that breakage by opening up an issue (titled <em>"An in-range update of [dependency-name] is breaking the build"</em>) and will also let you know whether pinning the dependency to the previous version will fix the build. In addition, Greenkeeper will keep checking if any new version of that dependency fixes this version’s breakage, and will also notify you about that in the issue thread. </p>
          <figure class="wide-img">

          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="signal">It’s an out-of-range update:</strong>
          <p>Greenkeeper opens a pull request, and your CI runs there. Your users would never encounter this version because it’s out of range, but if the update contains changes you want (security fixes, performance improvements, better compatibility etc.), this pull request is a good basis for work in that regard. Plus, if you trust your tests and they all pass, you could merge the pull request straight away.</p>
          <figure class="wide-img">
            <img

            <figcaption>An example of a pull request triggered by an out-of-range update</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>You’ll only get one pull request per dependency, if additional updates come in, Greenkeeper will update that pull request with the new dependency version (triggering your CI), and add a comment to let you know about the update.</p>
          <figure class="wide-img">
            <img

              alt="">
            <figcaption>A follow-up update for an out-of-range update will appear as an update to the original pull request</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p><strong>Out-of-range means:</strong> If you specify a range of <code>^1.0.0</code>, and <code>2.0.0</code> is released, that update is out-of-range. Users of your package will never encounter this update unless you bump the dependency’s version number and release your package again. Consult <a href="https://semver.npmjs.com">npm’s semver calculator</a> to see which updates apply to your specified ranges, per package.</p>

    <h3><a class="anchor-icon" href="#resetting_repos" id="resetting_repos">&middot;</a>Resetting a repository</h3>
    <p>Sometimes, the Initital Pull Request will never be opened. This can have many reasons, </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>If it exists, delete the <code>greenkeeper/initial</code> branch on the repo.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Remove the repo from the Greenkeeper integration in the app installation settings on GitHub and save. You can find a link to those settings in the <a href="https://account.greenkeeper.io">Account Dashboard</a>, at the bottom of the corresponding account’s repository list. The link is unique for every GitHub account, so we can’t link to it here.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>On the same page, add the repo again, and save.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>We’re working on making this more convenient by allowing you to reset repositories in the Account Dashboard.</p>

    <h3><a class="anchor-icon" href="#pinning" id="pinning">&middot;</a>Pinning a dependency</h3>
    <p>Pinning a dependency is a legitimate option when you don’t have the time or resources to fix a problem introduced by a dependency update. Greenkeeper will let you know whether pinning to the dependency’s previous version (downgrading) would solve the new issue, and will then give you that option in the issue thread.</p>

      <figcaption>When a dependency update breaks your build, Greenkeeper lets you pin the last working version right there in the GitHub issue.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Once you’ve pinned a package, every subsequent update to it will be considered out-of-range by Greenkeeper.</p>
