      <h1>Always up-to-date dependencies, zero hassle.</h1>
      <p>Tired of keeping all your dependencies up to date? Uncomfortable with just pinning them? Yup, so are we. So we made <strong>greenkeeper: it knows when your dependencies get updated and just sends you a pull request with the new package.json</strong>. If you've got continuous integration tests, they'll run, and you can keep your software up to date with a single click on the merge button.</p>
      <h2>Flippin' sweet, how does it work?</h2>
      <p>Easy: Open your terminal, and</p>
      <strong>$ npm install -g greenkeeper</strong>
      <p>Then inside the repo you want to keep up to date, do</p>
      <strong>$ greenkeeper enable</strong>
