    <h2>Always up-to-date npm dependencies, zero&nbsp;hassle</h2>
    <p>Not motivated to keep all your dependencies up to date, all the time? Uncomfortable with using loose version ranges? Yup, so are we. So we made Greenkeeper:</p>
    <p><strong>It knows when your dependencies got updated and simply sends you a pull request with the new package.json</strong>.</p>
    <p>Should a new version inside your existing version range cause your build to fail, we‚Äôll let you know immediately.</p>
    <p>If you‚Äôve got continuous integration tests, they‚Äôll run, and you can <strong>keep your software up to date with a single click</strong> on GitHub‚Äôs merge button.</p>

    <h2>Automate your dependency management</h2>
    <p>It's a chore nobody wants to do, and that often ends up not getting done at all. Greenkeeper makes it easy to keep your software shiny and functional, and leaves you more time to build interesting things.</p>
    <h3>Free for Open Source</h3>
    <p>Greenkeeper is free for public repositories on GitHub, but if you want to use it with private repos, there's a monthly charge. <a href="#plans">Check out our plans and pricing below!</a></p>

<div class="double-flex full-height">
  <section>
    <h2><span class="green">01</span> How it works</h2>
    <p>Greenkeeper sits between npm and GitHub, observing all of the modules you depend on. When they get updated, your project gets a pull request with that update. Your CI tests kick in, and Greenkeeper watches them to see whether they pass. If they do, you can just click the <strong>merge</strong> button, and we'll even auto-close branches for older versions for you. If not, you can use the branch to fix things.</p>
    <p>Trust us, you‚Äôll be amazed at how many dependency updates you‚Äôve been missing.</p>
    <p>Let the friendly Greenkeeper robot take all the dull work of keeping your dependencies up to date off your shoulders and, optimally, boil it all down to a single click. <strong>This is as close to fully automatic as we could possibly make it.</strong></p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Why it‚Äôs so great</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Staying on top of dependency updates is a lot of cognitive overhead: your code depends on modules that depend on modules. It's modules all the way down. Stuff gets updated all the time. It‚Äôll either annoy you, or you‚Äôll miss it.</li>
      <li><strong>Version pinning</strong> would save you the hassle, but you‚Äôll miss bugfixes and new features, and when you do have to update everything in the future, it‚Äôll probably be a huge mess. So let‚Äôs not pin.</li>
      <li><strong>Version ranges</strong> would be nice, but suffer from the fact that SemVer has‚Ä¶ room for interpretation, and module authors simply make mistakes from time to time.</li>
      <li>You could do all the updates by hand, all the time. But that‚Äôs dull, repetetive work, which is why, let‚Äôs be honest, barely anyone actually does it.</li>
